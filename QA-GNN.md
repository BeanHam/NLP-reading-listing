## MRC with Graph Neural Network (GNN)

:+1: : relevant :question: : still need to understand

Graphs in question-answering domain are usually referred as knowledge graphs (KG). In our case, however, we do not work with knowledge-based QA. Instead, we work on MRC-QA, the dataset of which usually does not come with knowledge graphs. Therefore, we focus on the literature that automatically **generates** graphs.
